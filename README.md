A project to learn about and make simple, slow reference implementations
of raster classification algorithms.

Implementations are planned to be in Javascript initially.

## Algorithms

### Decision Tree

* [ID3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm) - implementation started
* [C4.5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4.5_algorithm)

### Linear

* [Naive Bayes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier)

### References
